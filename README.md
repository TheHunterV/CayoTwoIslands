# CayoTwoIslands üèùÔ∏è

## This is the OFFICIAL repository of CayoTwoIslands. I am not associated with Popcorn RP and do not appreciate them taking my work and claiming it as their own.


Designed for RP and exploration in mind, CayoTwoIslands does everything [Cayo Improvements](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/CayoImprovements) does, except one important and highly requested feature; no more concealment.

---------------------------------------


 CayoTwoIslands enhances the island by removing obstructing collisions, adds more vegetation, street lights, heist props and socializing opportunities.

**This resource is for FiveM usage with the understanding that you will not modify, sell or reupload elsewhere without my permission.**

It is to work alongside [[pmms](https://github.com/kibook/pmms)] for playing content on the TV screens, as well as [[fivem-scenarios](https://github.com/kibook/fivem-scenarios)] for interacting with scenarios around the world, (like seats and scenarios) including Cayo Perico.

This is a passion project of mine that began in December of 2020 to self teach myself Codewalker and has been constantly updated and developed since.

Screenshots are provided in their respective folder.


I hope you enjoy üòä

# Configuring PMMS 

**Please see [Kibook's PMMS](https://github.com/kibook/pmms) for installation instructions and troubleshooting**

# Static Emitters üé∂

I have disabled the static emitters at the Arena Wars location, however if you are using PMMS alongside my Cayo Perico resource, PMMS disables static emitters when media is being rendered, and reenables them when the media has stopped playing, therefore, it counteracts with this resource. 

To 'fix' this, open the `staticEmitters.lua` file inside the PMMS resource, and set the following to false like so;

```
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_Arena_Crowd_Background_Main", enabled = false},
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_xs_arena_VIP_Radio", enabled = false},
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_xs_x18_int_mod_garage_radio", enabled = false},
{name = "SE_DLC_AW_xs_x18_int_mod2_garage_radio", enabled = false},
```

# BUGS üêõ

- some IPL Loader scripts have the following code:

```lua
LoadMpDlcMaps()
EnableMpDlcMaps(true)
```

This conflicts with Cayo Perico and the hangar, as my resources are already requesting the required IPLs, maps, and entitysets. 

Set it to false and request your IPLs the correct way.

- Player may not be able to move their cursor any further than Cayo Perico, if they are inside any of the interiors on the island, however it seems to fix itself once the player leaves the interior


---------------------------------------

# **HANGAR COLLISIONS: üõ©Ô∏è**

`Original Hangar Collision` folder provided. If you happen to have the '"[Cayo Perico Shops MLO](https://forum.cfx.re/t/mlo-cayo-perico-shops/1994908)' resource, as well as mine, the server refuses to read the collision file for shops, but instead, read mine, making the shop collisions not work. 

Just copy and paste mine, or the Cayo Perico Shops collision file **(h4_islandairstrip_12)** into the ybn folder. 

---------------------------------------

# Frameworks & Other Cayo Perico Resources / Scripts Support:

I don't use any fancy frameworks or any other Cayo Perico related resources, so you'll have to troubleshoot it on your **own.** These are simply ymap, ytyp and ybn files.

---------------------------------------


# Installation ‚öôÔ∏è: 

* Download repository and put the `CayoTwoIslands` folder in your server files

* Add `h4_islandairstrip_12` from the `Original Hangar Collison` folder, and insert it into `CayoTwoIslands` > `stream` > `ybn` folder. If you are using the Cayo Perico Shops resource, ignore this step

* add `start CayoTwoIslands` to your server.cfg

* Restart server or type `/start CayoTwoIslands` into the chat window 


--------------------

# FAQ üí¨

**Q: How can I change what's inside the cabinet in the basement?**

**A:** These are called entitysets and can be changed in the cayo_perico_entitysets.lua file.

------------

**Q: Can I delete, change or turn off the invincible NPC peds on the island?**

**A:** Yes, open peds_config.lua and everything has been configured there. You can add / remove entries, or comment it out from the fxmanifest to completely disable them.

You will also need to comment out main_peds.lua if you want to disable them completely.

------------

**Q: When I use this resource, I can't use Rockstar Editor. Why?**

**A:** This should be fixed, as the Cfx.re team have pushed an update on February 8th 2022 which implemented some CPacketIPL changes for the replay editor. This should fix replay editor issues on build 2189 and above with common IPL loading resources.

Read about it [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/cfx-re-client-update-fivem-redm-for-february-8th-2022/4813410)

------------

**Q: I bought something from someone that looked similar to this?**

**A:** Yikes. My resources are always free and some people pry on free resources to sell them off as their own, usually on some shady website or their discord servers. 

Unfortunately you've been scammed and I cannot help you get a refund or anything of that manner.

------------

**Q: Can you move the island to...**

**A: NO.**

------------------

**Q: My server has a bridge going to Cayo Perico but there's trees in the way, can you remove them?**

**A: NO. It's an island. Fly a plane or drive a boat.**

------------------

**Q: Can I DM you / can you help me personally one on one?**

**A:** No. Don't DM me on the FiveM forums and don't try to add me on Discord.
